# JAVA-BOOKSTORE

**Introduction**

I am pleased to present to you my BookStore project. I approached the creation of this project with great responsibility and attention to detail. In it, I have implemented all the basic functions that an online store should have so that every book lover can easily find the books they are interested in and order them with just a few clicks.

## Description of the project

The main idea was to create a functionality that would allow performing the functions of an online bookstore.

* A user with the status (Administrator) can manage most processes in the bookstore (Add new books, add new book categories, delete books, etc.)
* Every potential user can enter the store and view all the books in the store without registration.
* After registration, the user receives the status (User), and the bookstore automatically creates a shopping cart for the user.
* Users can add books to the shopping cart, where they will wait for order creation.
* When a User decides to create an order, they only need to insert the shipping address, and the books from the shopping cart will move to the order.
* After the User presses "create a new order," all books from the shopping cart are marked as deleted and removed from the shopping cart, making it empty again.
* The new order gets the status (Pending), and after the user receives the order, the administrator can change the status to (Completed).
  In the future, users can check information about previous orders.

## How to Run the Application

**Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

* **Java** **17**+

## Challenges Faced During Development

Developing the BookStore project was an enriching experience, but it also came with its own set of challenges. Here are some of the key challenges I faced and the strategies I used to overcome them:

**1. Managing User Authentication and Authorization**

**Challenge:** Implementing secure user authentication and ensuring proper authorization for different user roles (Admin and User) was crucial.

**Solution:**

* I used JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. This involved creating a custom filter to intercept HTTP requests and validate JWT tokens.
* To manage user roles and permissions, I integrated Spring Security, which allowed me to easily define role-based access control for different endpoints.

**2. Handling Data Consistency and Transactions**

**Challenge**: Ensuring data consistency during operations like creating orders, updating shopping carts, and managing book inventory was complex, especially in a multi-user environment
**Solution:**

* I leveraged Springâ€™s @Transactional annotation to manage transactions effectively. This ensured that all database operations within a transaction were completed successfully, or none were applied at all, maintaining data integrity.
* For complex operations, I implemented appropriate locking mechanisms to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency.

**3. Designing a Flexible and Scalable Data Model**

**Challenge:** Designing a data model that could handle various entities like books, categories, users, orders, and shopping carts while remaining flexible and scalable.

**Solution:**

* I used a relational database and designed the schema with normalization principles to ensure data integrity and minimize redundancy.
* To handle schema changes efficiently, I used Liquibase for database migration management. This allowed me to track, version, and deploy database schema changes reliably.

**4. Providing Detailed and User-Friendly API Documentation**
**Challenge**: Creating comprehensive and user-friendly API documentation that could help other developers understand and use the API effectively.

**Solution:**

* I integrated Swagger into the project. Swagger automatically generated interactive API documentation from my Spring Boot application, making it easier for users to explore and test the API endpoints.
* I also provided detailed descriptions, request/response examples, and parameter explanations to enhance the clarity and usability of the documentation.

**5. Containerizing the Application for Consistent Environments**

**Challenge**: Ensuring that the application runs consistently across different environments (development, testing, production) was crucial for smooth deployment and operation.: Ensuring that the application runs consistently across different environments (development, testing, production) was crucial for smooth deployment and operation.

**Solution:**

* I used Docker to containerize the application. Docker allowed me to package the application and its dependencies into a single container, ensuring consistency across various environments.
* I created Dockerfiles and Docker Compose configurations to simplify the process of building and running the application in different environments.

**6. Handling Error Management and User Feedback**
**Challenge**: Implementing a robust error-handling mechanism to provide meaningful feedback to users and developers when something goes wrong.

**Solution:**

* I developed a CustomGlobalExceptionHandler that captured and handled different types of exceptions globally. This ensured that users received clear and consistent error messages, and developers could easily identify and debug issues.
* I also used proper HTTP status codes to indicate the outcome of API requests, providing a better user experience.

By addressing these challenges with appropriate solutions, I was able to create a robust and scalable BookStore application that provides a seamless experience for both administrators and users.
